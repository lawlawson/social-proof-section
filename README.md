## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to practice semantic HTML and really challenged code considerations around using flexbox and grid. It was also a good opportunity to learn about working with background images and usage across different screen/device sizes. Generally there were some interesting layout considerations which proved challenging at times.
